Are you not of more value than they? And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.<br><br>" +

            <p>Hi, thank you for taking my quiz! I hope you took something out of it, but if not that's okay too. To be completely honest, I was originally very skeptical about religion in general, (let alone Christianity) before I experienced something earlier this year 2025. For the first 15 years of my life I was an athiest, and was only recently questioning my beliefs about a higher power. I knew of Christianity, have read the Bible a few times, but never thought that its teachings would align with me and that I would become a believer. However, at my very lowest point in a hospital emergency room, I genuinely felt Jesus's presence like never before. He gave me a comfort that I never knew was POSSIBLE or EXISTED, and I truly got to know Him the past few months and my WHOLE perspective has changed. I hope that a small part of my testimony may plant a small seed within you to have deeper questions about Christianity and about the world. Thank you taking the time out of your day to read this! Message me if you have any questions. :)</p>
